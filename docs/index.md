## What is Meshtastic?
Meshtastic is an community-based, open-source project that provides for a decentralized, off-grid mesh network built on low-powered devices. It's used
as a messaging platform that provides a backup for everyday communication. Many of us like to use it during disasters, power outages, or to enjoy as a hobby.
To learn about Meshtastic, check out their [offical homepage](https://meshtastic.org).
